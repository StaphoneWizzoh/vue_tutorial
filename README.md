# Vue Js crash course

## Directives

A way to connect to elements in the html with the Vue Js JavaScript
They are used as html attributes but prepended by a `v-` to differentiate them from regular html attributes.
Examples are:

1. `v-model` : Allows for two-way data binding.
2. `v-if`: Conditional statements. Takes in a boolean variable
3. `v-show`: Sets styling to display="none"
4. `v-cloak`: Hides anything from rendering until the page/application is ready.
